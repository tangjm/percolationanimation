### Percolation threshold visualisation 

A project that visualises percolation through a 2D grid.

Features 

- [x] Basic visualisation 

UI

- [ ] Change grid size 
- [ ] Change size of each site 
- [ ] Invert colours
- [ ] Revert to previous positions 
- [ ] Option to run simulations in parallel or in sequence.

Statistics 

- [x] Add statistics for the percolation threshold 
- [x] Mean threshold
- [x] Standard deviation for the threshold 
- [x] Have multiple instances of the percolation grid and perform many Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the percolation threshold. 

Learnings

- [x] Union Find data structure 
- [x] Canvas API 
- [x] Sequencing animations with delays between them by using the Async/Await syntax and setTimeout. 
- [x] Opportunity to try out Typescript
