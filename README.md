### Percolation threshold visualisation 

A project that visualises percolation through a 2D grid.

Features 

- [x] Basic visualisation 


- [ ] Change grid size 
- [ ] Change size of each site 
- [ ] Invert colours
- [ ] Revert to previous positions 

- [ ] Add statistics for the percolation threshold 
- [ ] Mean threshold
- [ ] Standard deviation for the threshold 
- [ ] Have multiple instances of the percolation grid and perform many Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the percolation threshold. 


Learnings

- [x] Union Find data structure 
- [x] Canvas API 
- [x] Sequencing animations with delays between them by using the Async/Await syntax and setTimeout. 
- [x] Opportunity to try out Typescript
